# Randwalk
In nature, physics, biology, chemistry, economics, and many other fields, random walk has practical applications. For example, it can describe the random movement of a pollen grain floating on the surface of a water droplet due to the forces exerted by water molecules. There are many such irregular and random natural phenomena and activities.()
